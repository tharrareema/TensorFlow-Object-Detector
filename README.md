## Object Detection using TensorFlow

### 🧠 Project Title
**Real-Time Custom Object Detection with TensorFlow and YOLO/SSD**

### 📘 Project Description
Implemented YOLO/SSD object detection on a **custom dataset** using TensorFlow. Accurately identifies, classifies, and locates objects for applications like inventory management, quality control, or surveillance.

### 🎯 Business Task
- Detect and bound custom objects in images/videos  
- Measure performance using **mAP**  
- Deploy for real-time inference on edge/cloud  

### 📁 Dataset Summary

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🖼 Images | Annotated images with target objects |
| 📝 Annotations | Bounding boxes (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max) and class labels |
| 🌈 Diversity | Varied lighting, angles, and backgrounds for robust generalization |

**Data Source:** Custom-labeled dataset

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python • TensorFlow / Keras • OpenCV • LabelImg / VGG Image Annotator • TensorBoard

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- **Data Augmentation:** Rotations, flips, brightness adjustments, scaling  
- **Transfer Learning:** Pretrained COCO weights for feature extraction  
- **Optimization:** Adam optimizer with learning rate decay  

### 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Result | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| mAP | 0.82 | High overall accuracy |
| FPS | 35 | Real-time video suitability |
| Localization Error | Low | Accurate bounding boxes |

### 💡 Strategic Recommendations
- Deploy as **TensorFlow Lite** for low-latency edge inference  
- Implement feedback loop to retrain on mispredicted images  
- Integrate as REST API for external applications  

✅ **Deployment:** Successfully deployed in a TensorFlow app for real-time inference.
